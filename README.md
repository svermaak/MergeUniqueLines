# MergeUniqueLines

This C# program merges unique lines from multiple input files, sorts them, and writes the result to an output file. It uses System.Diagnostics to track the execution time using a stopwatch. If there are fewer than two arguments, it displays usage instructions. The program reads each input file, adds unique lines to a HashSet, sorts all lines, and writes them to the destination file. If any errors occur, they are logged. Final statistics include the number of files processed, output file details, lines written, and execution time.
